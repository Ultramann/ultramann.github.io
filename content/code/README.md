## Code Made Blog Images Standard

There are a couple of things that should be followed to make code that creates images for the posts.

1. Each post for which images are being generated by code should have a directory in this one with the same name as the post.
2. In that directory there should be a Python script, `make_blog_images.py` which makes the images for the blog. In this way all of the plotting tasks are separated from the actual code script, which contains the code discussed in the blog post.
3. The `make_blog_images` script should reference the blog images directory via `../images`. This means that the script should be run from this directory. e.g.
  ```
  python numeric_python_intro/make_blog_images.py
  ```
